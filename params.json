The .jar then, indefinitely listens to \r\nit's STDIN in a blocking fashion. Upon receiving input, which\r\nmust be preformmated JSON, the running Java application will \r\nhandle the 'request', and eventually return a response by \r\nwriting a JSON message to STDOUT.\r\n\r\nA Node.js application is also running. Node.js acts as the\r\nHTTP server that clients interract with. Upon receiving a \r\nHTTP request, node will, if necesarry, talk to the running \r\nJVM via STDIN/STDOUT to fulfill requests.\r\n\r\nThe Node.js process is essentially acting as the bridge\r\nbetween the client and the business logic.\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n\r\nThe Java program handles all the business logic associated with\r\nCoplan, by communicating with a Node.js process via JSON-formatted\r\ncommands sent through STDIN/STDOUT.\r\n\r\nCommands are to be formatted in the following way:\r\n   - There are two essentail components: 'route', and 'data'\r\n   - 'route' specifies the endpoint you want to talk you\r\n   - 'data' specifies an object with keys and values pertinant to the endpoint\r\n   - If you attempt to access an endpoint without the needed requirements, an error message will be returned\r\n \r\n## Request Example \r\n{ \r\n   route: \"createUser\", \r\n   data: {\r\n      username: \"bshutt\",\r\n      firstName: \"Brady\",\r\n      lastName: \"Shutt\",\r\n      major: \"Computer Science\"\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n## Class Diagram\r\n![Class Diagram](/coplanDiagram.png)\r\n\r\n## Picture of Application \r\n![Application Picture](/currentState.png)\r\n\r\n",
